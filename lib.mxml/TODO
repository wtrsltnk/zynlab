TODO - 2007-11-22
-----------------

	- Add access methods and make node structure opaque.
	  -- To allow for C++ migration
	  -- To make future binary compatibility easier
	- Add C++ class/struct.
	  -- Make this the core implementation which the C API accesses?
	  -- Class would allow for subclassing, is that necessary?
	- Binary XML support???
